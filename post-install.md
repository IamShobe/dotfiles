## Install fonts
Configurations are using special fonts - that might not render for you.  
Installing fonts automatically is really dependent on the terminal emulator you are using.  

Recommanded font: [DejaVuSansMono NF](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono)  
Make sure to install all versions of the font (Italic, Bold, Bold-Italic, Regular) - for maximum experience!
